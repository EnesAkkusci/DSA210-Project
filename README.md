## Motivation

Youtube is the social media app I use by far the most and I am already aware that I might be spending too much time on it. By the analysis of my usage data I aim to observe patterns and habits I have and learn from them. This may better inform me about my time and content management regarding Youtube. I believe seeing just what and how I spend so much time on will be benefitial to me.

## Tools

The following are the tools I expect to use during the implementation of this project.

- JupyterNotebook
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Numpy

## Data Source

I used Youtube's requesting user data feature as my main source of data. This return all sorts of data regarding a Youtube account. I predict I will mostly end up using watch and search history and comment data from these. The returned data from Youtube is partially in .html, partially in .csv format.

## Data Analysis

Currently my plans are to analyse my watch history data for most observed channels, keywords in titles, topics and areas. With this I plan to detect patterns and create graphs to visualize repeating patterns. Similar processes can also be done to my search history data and comments.
