## Description

My name is Enes Akkusci and this is the repository for my Sabanci University CS210 Introduction to Data Science Course Project. 
This project will consist of analysis and the visualazation of my Youtube user data.

## Motivation

Youtube is the social media app I use by far the most and I am already aware that I might be spending too much time on it. By the analysis of my usage data I aim to observe patterns and habits I have and learn from them. This may better inform me about my time and content management regarding Youtube. I believe seeing just what and how I spend so much time on will be benefitial to me.

## Tools

The following are the tools and libraries I used during the implementation of this project.

- Jupyter Notebook : The platform I wrote and ran my code on.
- Pandas : A python library for reading csv files and using them with plotly.
- Plotly : A python library that uses csv file data to generate graphs.
- Numpy : A python library that is used for working with arrays.
- Matplotlib : A python library that is needed for some of the graphs used in the project.
- Beautiful Soup : A python library that reads and processes html.
- lxml : A improved html parser for the bs4 library that is faster than the default parser. 
- Word Cloud : The python library I used to generate the word cloud graph.

## Data Source

I used Youtube's requesting user data feature as my main source of data. This return all sorts of data regarding a Youtube account. I predict I will mostly end up using watch and search history and comment data from these. The returned data from Youtube is partially in .html, partially in .csv format.

## Data Analysis

Currently my plans are to analyse my watch history data for most observed channels, keywords in titles, topics and areas. With this I plan to detect patterns and create graphs to visualize repeating patterns. Similar processes can also be done to my search history data and comments.
